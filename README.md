# Image to Black and White Pixels
Convertes an image to black and white pixels and counts them

I was bored...

Just drag and drop the image file onto the `ImageToBLPixels.exe`

NOTE: This converts images to black and white pixels with a threshold of 128 (RGB colour). So you literally might get 0 black pixels...
